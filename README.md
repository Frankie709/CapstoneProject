# CapstoneProject
Text-Based Adventure Game for Capstone Project
Named after a Duke of Hell, Agaros and the Cursed
Realm is a text-based adventure game that follows a heroâ€™s journey as they seek to
recover their memory, and in doing so, stop the demon Agaros from overtaking the
realm. Inspiration was taken from current games and hit fantasy movies, but overall the
theme of the game was our own. The entire project was written in C++ in order to
capitalize on the use of inheritance and polymorphism which drove the flow of the
game. 

The game was written and tested on UNIX servers.

There is a makefile provided to assist in compiling the game. 
Simply type "make" in the terminal to compile the game.
And to run the game on a UNIX server, simply enter the command:
./agaros
